# Elephant Polo World Cup 2016 Registration

A simple registration form to post data into a database for later retrieval by the organisers.

Built using Laravel 5.2.39 because it ships with an Eloquent authentication driver. It was also used as a chance to learn about Laravel and how to use it.

All styling is Bootstrap because it came with Laravel, it's responsive out-of-the-box and no design was specified.
